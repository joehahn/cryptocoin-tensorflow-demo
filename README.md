### Abstract:

This simple demo illustrates the use of LSTM neural network to predict daily changes in the
Ethereum cryptocurrency. Source code is a Jupyter notebook that uses Keras on Tensorflow
to build a simple LSTM neural network to predict daily changes in Ethereum. This model is
trained on a very narrow dataset, namely the daily values and volumes of Bitcoin and Ethereum.
The following implicitly assumes that Bitcoin movements are driving the Ethereum valuations,
which is at best partly true but not sufficient for building an adequate predictive model
for Ethereum. But the principal goal here is to build a simple and test a LSTM model on
top of a simple dataset, and that at least is achieved
